The first MaptimeTurku meetup will intorduce us to making maps together. As it is our first time, we'll take it easy and start learning to use OpenStreetMap and making maps from our neighbourhood. If you are allready skilled at OpenStreetMap, we can start thinking about different thematic maps that we can publish in our map service http://karttapalvelu.lounaispaikka.fi

We'll meet at some public restaurant near city center! 

Remember, this is going to be fun!
